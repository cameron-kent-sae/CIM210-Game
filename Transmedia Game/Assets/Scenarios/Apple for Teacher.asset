  scenarioText: 'Serf schools have experienced a steady decline in graduation rates
    as more young people are being driven to the workforce to support their families
    and themselves. There might not be an issue here at all but we could direct funding
    to improve the rate of students graduating.

    A: Leave it be

    B: Donate
    Royal funds

    C: Increase Serf wages
