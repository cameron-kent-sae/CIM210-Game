  scenarioText: 'Noble clubs are filling with a new party narcotic which is causing
    users to become highly energised and not sleeping for days. There seems to be
    a negative impact on productivity but it also has morale up among the class.
    This could go either way.

    A: Ban the narcotic

    B: Regulate the drug

    C:
    Confiscate for Royal use'
